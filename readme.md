### **🛠️ Local Setup & Run**

To run this project locally, you must use a web server (like the one built into Python) to ensure the **EmailJS** service can communicate correctly, as browsers restrict file system-based API calls.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MannanFaiz/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/MannanFaiz/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Initialize a Local Server (Recommended: Python 3):**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
3.  **View:**
    Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
