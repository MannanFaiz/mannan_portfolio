### **🌟 Project Overview**

This is the personal portfolio website for **Mannan Faiz**, built to showcase my technical skills, professional experience, and projects. Designed to be clean, modern, and fully responsive, it serves as a dynamic, professional digital resume.

The site features dedicated sections for **About, Education, Skills, Projects,** and a direct **Feedback** form.

### **✨ Key Features**

* **⚡ Modern & Responsive:** Crafted with **Tailwind CSS** for a professional look that adapts perfectly to desktop and mobile screens.
* **💨 Smooth Navigation:** Implements `scroll-behavior: smooth` for a seamless and polished user experience between all sections.
* **📧 Functional Feedback:** A working contact form powered by **EmailJS** allows visitors to send feedback directly to my email inbox. Alerts for submission are handled using **SweetAlert2**.
* **🔗 Integrated Presence:** Quick access to my professional profiles on **LinkedIn, GitHub, LeetCode,** and **HackerRank**.

### **🛠️ Local Setup & Run**

To run this project locally, you must use a web server (like the one built into Python) to ensure the **EmailJS** service can communicate correctly, as browsers restrict file system-based API calls.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MannanFaiz/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/MannanFaiz/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Initialize a Local Server (Recommended: Python 3):**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
3.  **View:**
    Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
